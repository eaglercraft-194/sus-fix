### as most of the devs (including me) only know small patches of coding, this may never release. currently it is a entire rip of eaglercraft 1.8. we will be replacing this soon. also curse lfierro.
##### WE WILL MAKE IT PRIVATE FOR NOW.
#### DarvelCraft is a codename for right now, until the final release.
# what is Darvelcraft?
Darvelcraft [the project's codename] is Minecraft 1.9.4 in the browser, based on Eaglercraft, which is also a browser-based version of Minecraft [for 1.5.2 and 1.8.8] (where you can enjoy both singleplayer and multiplayer modes, and join real Minecraft servers through a custom proxy and modified software).

# what about server(s)?
sorry, currently we do not have the server software. we are studying the source of [ayunami](https://shhnowisnottheti.me)[20](https://github.com/ayunami2000)[00](https://replit.com/@ayunami2000)'s server software he made for Eaglercraft 1.5.2 and EaglercraftX (1.8.8) to get a better grasp of how to make the *S.S.* for Darvelcraft.
<br>
Replit sucks when you want extremely fast servers and 24/7 uptime.

### Mockup
Credit goes to SnesLover22 for creating the art. This is not final and we will NOT use the eaglercraftY name during the final release due to Mr. Stupid 9-Year Old, aka lfierro.
